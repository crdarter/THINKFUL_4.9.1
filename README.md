Monte Carlo Example

The instructions indicated that the Monte Carlo coin flipping simulation be manipulated for a "normal" variable.  I opted to modify it to simulate a single die being rolled.  This assumes that "normal" variable refers to a statistical qualifier and not a qualifier relating to a variable more likely to be encountered in a business problem.
